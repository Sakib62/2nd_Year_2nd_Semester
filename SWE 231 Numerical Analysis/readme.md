### Lecture-01: 29th August, 2022

Exact solution cannot always be extracted. We need to be as precise as we can.

Numerical analysis deals with approximate aolution. How much error(threshold value) will be accepted?

**Why use Numerical Methods?**
- to solve problems that cannot be solved exactly
- to solve problems that are intractable

**How to solve an engineering problem?**<br>
Problem Description->Mathematical Model->Solution of Mathematical model->Using the solution

*(~Need to follow this for Research/Journal~)*

**Mathematical Model:** Converting the problem into mathematics so that computer can help solve this problem.

**Using the solution:** Compare with existing solutions. 

*(~My note: Need to revise following course-> Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics~)*
