### Lecture-01: 29th August, 2022

Exact solution cannot always be extracted. We need to be as precise as we can.

Numerical analysis deals with approximate aolution. How much error(threshold value) will be accepted?

**Why use Numerical Methods?**
- to solve problems that cannot be solved exactly
- to solve problems that are intractable

**How to solve an engineering problem?**<br>
Problem Description->Mathematical Model->Solution of Mathematical model->Using the solution

*(~Need to follow this for Research/Journal~)*

**Mathematical Model:** Converting the problem into mathematics so that computer can help solve this problem.

**Using the solution:** Compare with existing solutions. 

*(~My note: Need to revise following course-> Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics~)*

### Lecture-02: 31th August, 2022

**Why measure errors?**
- to determine the accuracy of numerical results
- to develop stopping criteria for iterative algorithm

**Error**
- True error
- Relative true error
- Approximate error
- Relative approximate error
- Absolute relative approximate error (Used as a stopping criteria)
    - If |∈a|<=∈s where ∈s is a pre-specified tolerance, then no further iterations are necessary and the process is stopped.

**Mathematical Procedure**
- Nonlinear Equations
- Differentiation
- Simultaneous Linear Equations
- Curve Fitting
    - Interpolation
    - Regression
- Integration
- Ordinary Differential Equations

**Advanced Mathematical Procedure**
- Partial Differential Equations
- Optimization
- Fast Fourier Transforms

Matlab, octave??
