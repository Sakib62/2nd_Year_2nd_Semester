**Chapter 1 to 9**

### Chapter 1 - Introduction

- Goals of HCI
- Principles of HCI

### Chapter 2 -  Specific HCI Guidelines

- Principles are general, guidelines are specific
- Guidelines - Domain specific and General HCI Design
- **General HCI Design** : Visual Display Layout, Information Structure and Navigation, Taking User Input
- User with Disability
- Icons, Fonts, Earcon

### Chapter 3 - Human Factors as HCI Theories

- Human factors can be divided into - Cognitive Science and Ergonomics
- Human problem-solving model
- Gulf of execution/evaluation
- **GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules)**
- Modality - Visual, Aural, Haptic-Tactile
- Multimodal Interaction
- **Fitt's Law** - A model of human movement that predicts the time required to rapidly move to a target area as a function of the distance to and the size of the target
- Control-Display (C/D) Ratio

### Chapter 4 - HCI Design

- HCI design is the process of creating the basic framework for user interaction in software development.
- **HCI design is an 4 steps iterative process** - Requirement Analysis, User Analysis, Scenario and Task Analysis, Interface Selection and Consolidation.
- Interface Selection Options -> Hardware Platforms, Software Interface Components
- Hardware Platforms : Desktop, Smartphone, Tablet, Embedded, TV, Kiosk, VR etc.
- Software Interface Components : Windows/Layers, Icons, Menu
- Wire Framing 

### Chapter 8 - User Interface Evaluation

- When evaluating the interaction model and interface, there are largely two criteria: Usability & User Experience
- **Usability:** Refers to the ease of use and learnability of the user interface.
- Usability can be measured in two ways - Quantitatively & Qualitatively
- Qualitative Evaluations : NASA TLX (Task Load Index) and the IBM Usability Questionnaire
- **User Experience:** It involves the user's emotions and 
perceptions arising from using the application through a given interface
- Evaluation method can be characterized by: Timing of analysis, Type and number of evaluators, Formality, Place of the evaluation.
- **Wizard of Oz** testing, with a human simulating system responses, is used when features are not implemented.
- **The cognitive walkthrough** where the subject talks through their thought process. It's designed to identify gaps between the system's interaction model and the user's understanding.
- **Institutional Review Board (IRB)** reviews the proposed evaluative experiments to ascertain safety and the rights of the subjects. 

### Chapter 9 - Future of HCI

- **Four major computing platforms**: Mobile and handheld platform, Ubiquitous, Natural and immersive computing/sensing/display, Cloud computing.
- Gestures alone can convey meaning, or they can function in a supplemental role in other modes of communication.
- Supplementary pointing vs Symbolic gestures
- Inside-Out vs Outside-In Method
- Motion-based interaction faces difficulty in 
distinguishing meaningful gestures from continuous motion tracking data.
- **Mixed Reality (MR)**: Combines real and virtual worlds with varying proportions of each.
- **Augmented Virtuality (AV)**: Predominantly virtual content with some real-world elements.
