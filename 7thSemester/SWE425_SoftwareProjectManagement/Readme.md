### Unit-1: Introduction to Software Project Management

- A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service.
- **Triple constraint of projects - time, budget, quality**

- Stepwise Project Planning
- Activity Planning
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
- Critical Path Method (CPM)
- Total float, Free float, Interfering float

<hr>

### Unit-4: Monitoring and Control

- Gantt Chart
- **Earned Value Analysis**
    - Three quantities form the basis for cost performance measurement using Earned Value
Management
        - Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV)
        - Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) and
        - Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC).
    - **Cost Variance, Schedule Variance**
    - **Cost Performance Index (CPI), Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**
    
    - [**Earned value analysis worked example**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7b3SYQuqJM)
