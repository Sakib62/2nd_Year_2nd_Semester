<h2>Lecture-01: 22nd February, 2023</h2>

- OOP concept important for this course
    - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Scalable, Maintainable, Following certain architecture, convention
- 16 Design Pattern
- Solid Principle
- Code Smell, Refactoring
- Workflow, P-value

<br><h2>Lecture-02: 26th February, 2023</h2>

- OOP concept, Access modifier
- Class Diagram basics
- Structure of the class
    - Atrributes
    - Operations
    - | Class Name |
      | :--: |
      | **Attributes**<br>-member1: int (*private*)<br>+member2: str (*public*)<br>#member3: float (*protected*)|
      | **Operations**<br>-method1(): int (*return type is int*)<br>+method2: str<br>#method3: bool|
- Relationship between classes
    - Association
    - Inheritance
    - Dependency

* **To-do**: Maintain Github Repo and update it with solution of class task.

* **Task-1** :: Java Code for [Class Diagram Example: Order System](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-class-diagram-tutorial/)

### Blog - [**Solid Principles**](https://shuhanmirza.medium.com/s-o-l-i-d-principle-the-superheros-guide-to-writing-clean-code-d67324506ecf) 

(*Vpn may be required to access the link*)

- i) Single Responsibility Principle
- ii) Open-Closed Principle 
    - Classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

**To-do**: Revise Collection Framework in Java

<br><h2>Lecture-04: 12th March, 2023</h2>

- iii) Liskov Substitution Principle
- iv) Interface Segregation Principle
- v) Dependency Inversion Principle

**Upcoming:** Solo Project that fulfill Solid Principles

<br><h2>Lecture-05: 20th March, 2023</h2>

- [Identify which SOLID principle is violated here. Rewrite the code with the correct version.](https://gist.github.com/CosmicBeing09/483ed9f64630dd595e1d6edacde7312d)

- Can have many approach to rewrite correct code. Need to ensure how efficient the design is.
- Design Pattern
    - Creational
    - Structural
    - Behavioral
