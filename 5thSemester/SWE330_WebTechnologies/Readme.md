<h2>Lecture-01: 26th February, 2023</h2>

**Course Outline**
- HTTP & how it works?
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript
- Authentication

**Tasks:**
- Weekly Presentation
- Question Answer Session

**2 Solo Project:**
- i) JavaScript
- ii) Node JS. Idea from sir. Site using vanilla JS

<hr>

**Web Application**
- i) Client-Server Architecture
    - 2 apps. Client is front-end, receives response.
    - Server is back-end, performs user request, business logic, database interaction.
- ii) Model-View-Controller Architecture
    - 1 app, 3 part. Controller is communication medium.

**Micro Service Architecture**
- Multiple apps in back-end
- Debug easy
- Industry level
- Deployment minimalist

**Task 1: Categories of HTTP Request. How it works?**
- [**Study Plan on HTTP and REST**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVcgm1lyuB9rhXaalQdnsC-Udcg75-0h/view?usp=drive_link)
- Study and explore! Prepare for presentation.

**To-do:** In any site: Inspect, Console, Source, Network, Performance etc.

<br><h2>Lecture-05: 15th May, 2023</h2>

- JavaScript Overview

<br><h2>Lecture-06: 25th May, 2023</h2>

`Online Class`

- JavaScript engine, how JS runs?

<br><h2>Lecture-07: 12th June, 2023</h2>

- **JavaScript Execution**
    - Js Runtime Engine
    - Install **node js** and run `node file1.js` in terminal
    - JS runs on **single thread**.
    - Heap and Stack.
    - Passes lengthy function to browser via **web api** 
    - After execution, browser passes result to stack via **Event Loop**
    - Results from event loop are pushed to stack only if stack is empty. <br>They are pushed to stack before another function from JS file is pushed to stack.
    - Thus, with the help of browser, parallel execution happens.
    - Arrow function, anonymous. `a( () => console.log("hi") );`
    - **Fetch**
    - **Promise** (Resolve, Reject, Catch, Finally)
    - async, await
    - In web api, **promise** is executed before **settimeout**
