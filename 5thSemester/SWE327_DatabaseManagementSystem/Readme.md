`Theory Class`

**Book:** Database System Concepts - 6th Edition. by Silberschatz, Korth, Sudarshan

Database => Collection of inter-related data.

- **Database Architecture**
    - Parallel, Distributed, Centralized etc.
- **Drawbacks of file system**
    - Data Redundancy & Inconsistency
    - Concurrency access (All transaction must be isolated)
    - Atomicity of updates etc.
- **Levels of abstraction**
    - Physical, Logical, View

<br>
<blockquote>
Schema = Logical structure of the database.<br>
Instance = Actual content of the database at a particular point in time.<br>
Physical Data Independence = Reduce Dependency
</blockquote><br>

**Data Model**<br>
Relational Model -- *Follow convention*

DDL = Data Definition Language<br>
DML = Data Manipulation Language

Primary key, Foreign key<br>
SQL (in later class)

<br>

**ER Diagram -> Schema -> DML**

<blockquote>
Database Design
-> Logical, Physical<br>
Entity-Relationship Model<br>
XML = Extensible Markup Language
-> Defined by WWW Consortium (W3C)

</blockquote><br>

Query Processing<br>
..............................

<blockquote>
Non-Technical - Business Requirement Specification (BRS)<br>
Logical - Use Case, Process Flow, ERD, Risk, Constraint<br>
Database Programming - Convert into tabular database
</blockquote><br>

**To-do:** 
- Don't keep 'User' entity in ER Diagram
- Buy hard copy of book.
